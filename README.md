AlkaneBoilingPoints This simple code plots the number of car-
bon atoms in the alkane on the x-axis and the boiling points of

that alkane on the y-axis. It generates a properly labeled graph
using Matplotlib.
This is part of the CobberLearnChem Machine Learning course
through Concordia College.

Alongside my public coding projects, I’m keeping a private
ethics portfolio where I reflect on what I’m learning and how
it’s shaping the kind of scientist I want to become.

Molecule Explorer is a program that fetches a molecule and extracts data from a package called RDKit. 

PubChemFetcher is a program that gives me the properties of molecules for research in a cool output style.
