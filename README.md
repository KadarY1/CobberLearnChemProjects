AlkaneBoilingPoints This simple code plots the number of car-
bon atoms in the alkane on the x-axis and the boiling points of

that alkane on the y-axis. It generates a properly labeled graph
using Matplotlib.
This is part of the CobberLearnChem Machine Learning course
through Concordia College.

Alongside my public coding projects, I’m keeping a private
ethics portfolio where I reflect on what I’m learning and how
it’s shaping the kind of scientist I want to become.

Molecule Explorer is a program that fetches a molecule and extracts data from a package called RDKit. 

PubChemFetcher is a program that gives me the properties of molecules for research in a cool output style.

In the DecisionTreeClassifier project, I apply decision tree logic to a new chemical prediction task: determining whether a molecule is water-soluble. Unlike previous work predicting numerical values (such as boiling points), this task is a **classification problem**, where the model predicts one of two categories—soluble or not soluble.

To solve this problem, I used Python’s `DecisionTreeClassifier` from the `scikit-learn` library. The model learns decision rules based on molecular properties commonly associated with solubility.
